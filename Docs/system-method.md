# 🜏 System & Method for Adaptive Neurodivergent Support Daemon 🜏  

## 🧠 The VEIL Protocol  
**V.E.I.L. = Versatile Ensemble for Interruption-prioritized Learning**

This protocol defines a modular neuroadaptive system built around consent-first logic, symbolic signaling, and real-time stress-state detection. It combines Hierarchical Reinforcement Meta-learning (HRM), a persona-driven LLM layer, and glyph-based UI overlays to manage user cognitive state and ritual interaction.

---

## **Abstract**
This system provides a modular, adaptive companion interface that monitors user signals, predicts overload states, and responds through symbolic rituals and contextual conversation.  

The architecture includes:
- **Watcher Daemons** for real-time signal capture
- **State Engine** for stress-state computation
- **HRM** (Hierarchical Resonance Mapping) for adaptive decisioning
- **LLM-based Persona Layer** for mythic voice expression
- **Glyph-Based Ritual UI** for low-load emotional signaling

Unlike traditional therapeutic tools, this system centers **user sovereignty** through interruption-first logic, encrypted local-first logs, and a modular ecosystem of persona and logic packs.

## 🛠️ Core System Components

### 1. **Watcher Daemons**  
Monitor:
- Heart rate (biofeedback)
- Ambient sound (mic chaos, yelling detection)
- Motion/activity level
- Keyword triggers (coercion, authority)

### 2. **State Engine**  
- Computes Spoon/Wick depletion  
- Maps stress indicators to glyphs  
- Emits symbolic states (e.g., 🛡 Warden, 🕯 Candle)

### 3. **HRM Core**  
**H.R.M. = Hierarchical Resonance Mapping**

- Adapts based on user response history  
- Refines its own adaptation pathways over time (meta-learning)  
- Chooses rituals dynamically based on learned reward feedback

### 4. **Persona Layer (LLM)**  
- Translates HRM intent into symbolic, stylized voice  
- Controlled via Persona Packs (tone, speech cadence, lexicon)
- Examples: mythpunk daemon, glitch angel, cozy witch

### 5. **Ritual UI**  
- Displays symbolic glyphs instead of text-heavy output  
- Enables fast override gestures and voice commands  
- Optional AR overlay and daemon avatar packs

## 🔁 Method Overview

1. **Signal Detection**  
   - Watchers detect threshold events  
   - Events flagged for wick/spoon state changes  

2. **State Evaluation**  
   - State engine emits glyph  
   - Example: wick = 22%, yelling = true → 🛡 Warden glyph → Activate SCP-27  

3. **Adaptive Response (HRM)**  
   - Chooses best-fit ritual  
   - Considers recent feedback  
   - Favors responses that result in calm interrupts or positive reinforcement  

4. **Persona Invocation (LLM)**  
   - HRM intent passed to LLM  
   - Response stylized via persona pack (e.g., “My light’s flickering. You need stillness.”)

5. **UI Execution**  
   - Glyph overlay triggers  
   - Audio, AR, or haptic response layered as needed  
   - Logs ritual response and user override

## 🧩 Plugin Ecosystem (DAEMON System)

**D.A.E.M.O.N. = Dynamic Adaptive Engine for Meta-Operative Navigation**

- Plugin system includes:
  - Logic Packs → ritual rules + thresholds  
  - Persona Packs → tone, vocabulary, glyph palette  
  - ARG Packs → geo-rituals, scavenger glyph quests  
- Packs can be shared or locked via ritual token DRM

## 🜏 Innovation Claims (Patent-Oriented)

> A system and method for symbolic cognitive regulation comprising:  
> a multi-signal detection architecture (Watchers),  
> an adaptive threshold state engine (Wick/Spoon mapping),  
> a Hierarchical Resonance Mapping core for decision adaptation,  
> and a symbolic ritual interface driven by a persona-tuned language model.

> All components operate under an interruption-prioritized user logic protocol, allowing consent-first overrides, encrypted logging, and modular expansion via logic/persona/glyph plugin architecture.

## 📌 Summary
The **VEIL Protocol** defines a self-evolving daemon framework for symbolic care.  
It is OSS at the code level, protected at the mythic layer, and adaptable at the emotional interface.
