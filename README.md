## 👁️ **What Is VeilDaemon?**

VeilDaemon is an **open-source, AI-powered companion** forged for neurodivergent survival.
It listens like a daemon process: **always running, never in the way… until you need it.**

🜏 This is **not** a therapy app.
It’s a **myth-tech interface for surviving the noise.**
