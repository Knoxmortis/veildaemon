**Resonance-Aware Companion for Neurodivergent Meltdown Management**  
*“Not all daemons are demons—some just help you hold it together.”*

## 👁️ What Is VeilDaemon?

**VeilDaemon** is an open-source AI-powered companion app designed to help **neurodivergent individuals**—especially those with autism, ADHD, or bipolar conditions—**track, visualize, and manage emotional overload or meltdown states**.

Blending **quantum logic**, **resonance theory**, and **sensor-aware UI**, it acts like a daemon process: always running, always listening, never in the way… until you need it.

This is not a therapy app.  
It’s a **myth-tech interface** for surviving the noise.

## 🧠 Core Features (Base Concept)

- 🔥 **Meltdown Detection Engine**  
  Uses heart rate, ambient sound, and behavioral data to track rising stress patterns in real-time

- 🥄 **Spoon Counter**  
  Tracks emotional/mental energy with customizable decay timers and daily resets via sleep tracking (Samsung Health integration planned)

- 🧩 **Resonance Profile Setup**  
  Users answer guided questions to build a mythic neuro-profile (e.g., Autistic Empath, ADHD Spellweaver, Bipolar Seer)

- 🎧 **Soothing Trigger Responses**  
  Plays custom Spotify playlists, white noise, or rain sounds based on preset thresholds

- 🔊 **Mic Input Awareness**  
  Detects yelling/ambient chaos as potential triggers to raise the alert level

- 🧘‍♀️ **Voice Commands**  
  “Activate Meditation Mode” or “Talk to Me” to trigger grounding or reflective features

- 📓 **Dream Logging + Pattern Recognition** *(planned)*  
  Log sleep disturbances or vivid dreams and optionally correlate them to stress patterns, EMF/Schumann spikes, or glyph triggers
